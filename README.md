# Synonsis

This project is built with React and Typescript, with Zustand as state-management tool.

# Notes:
* Created modular UI compoenents for presentation layer
* Create a global store for BBox state and its change method (using Zustand)
* Created a custom hook for fetching and displaying appropriate data in the component
* Added basic unit testing for UI elements

# Improvements:
* Tried to implement tests for custom hook and store, but got TypeError. Thus, I left the testing for hooks and store logic. 
* I am open to learn advanced unit and integration testing as it will not take a lot of time to learn.
* Add Popups on Markers in Map for UX.
